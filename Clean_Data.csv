L'individu à l’accueil s'est permis de dire à mon mari qu'il était ""trop lent"" lors de l'enregistrement ... c'est inacceptable ! De plus, la climatisation est extrêmement bruyante, plusieurs d'entre nous ont eu beaucoup de difficulté à dormir.

9,"Enjoyed our stay! Staff was welcoming and friendly. Chose this location for a weekend with my friends. When booking this room I requested a rollaway bed. When I called the front desk about the extra bed I requested, it was explained to me since we have two beds they could not accommodate us with a rollaway. Why give that an option during booking but not available during the stay? Overall it was a nice experience.

12,"Sent my parents on an anniversary trip, They wanted to stay local but wanted to get away from the heat in Riverside so they stayed here for two days. They said the property was secluded, clean and they felt safe in this area. The hotel itself was clean, comfortable and they had a nice view. The staff were friendly and found their reservation with no issues. ONLY downside is that they had to pay $20 per day for parking. The parking was private and they didn't worry about their car being broken into so that was a plus but it was an extra cost we didn't expect. Great location for site seeing.

14,"This property is advertised as being renovated. Only four floors are renovated and a renovation means basically new bedding. There were stains on the ceiling, a leaking shower, toilet that didn't work, peeling paint and an unpleasant manager when we asked to change our room. He seemed to think a non-working toilet wasn't an issue. I would not recommend nor ever stay in this property again. It was very disappointing.

16,"L’unica cosa accettabile è stata la cortesia ricevuta al check out. Tutto il resto da cancellare. Camera vecchia, male insonorizzata mobili vecchi e maltenuti, illuminazione fatta malissimo e, nonostante tutto abbiamo faticato a farcela assegnare. La prima camera che abbiamo ricevuto è al piano della strada con i parcheggi a 50 metri, questa camera è maleodorante di con mobili vecchi e scrostati. Guardate attentamente le condizioni perché compaiono 25$/giorno per i servizi che dicono di offrire come ad esempio la navetta per i parchi ma non è così. Le navette non servono i parchi degli Universal Studios e non servono l’aeroporto quindi l’unico modo per spostarsi è il taxi peraltro abbastanza costoso. Una mattina si sono inventati un aumento di $ 11 + tasse e mancia al 18% a persona a perché ospitavano alcuni osceni personaggi Disney !!!

 There were stinky fruits all over the pool areas. They just tried to blow them under the bushes. STINKY!
 I needed my safe opened, and it took a long time to get them to do it. Most of the room was clean except mold in the shower. It rained a lot and there were NO inside activities. How about yoga or Zumba in the rainy season? I definitely Won't be back.

33,"This is a pleasant hotel, I was a little disappointed that I had to go to the restaurant and order take out for pool side dining. Not a bad thing but I did not expect that - I had to order the food, then go back 10 mins later. When I good a hotel with a pool and restaurant in the photos I do expect that little bit of service.
 They also charged $100 incidental charge. Was not expected it to be deducted and then have to wait 3 - 5 days for it to be returned to my account. Not cool!

36,"1st off - I knew right away I wouldn’t be staying at this property again. Right after check in, we go to self park, only to find out that we weren’t given a code for the gate. Go up to Valet, get the code, go get in our room. Mind you, self parking and our room were on COMPLETELY opposite sides of the hotel property. Next, I realize I was charged for parking and forgot to mention that we had a handicap tag. I call the front desk, explain, and get told that I would get a refund to the card I put on file. Sounds great, problem solved. Next day, hadn’t received any notification for the refund and ALSO got a notice on our car that it was going to get towed because I didn’t have a parking tag on the dash.....when I wasn’t given anything by the front desk. I go talk to the front desk after our morning at the park & they say that they do charge for handicap and end up giving me a parking tag. Overall, it was not worth even the small cost of the stay. If staying at this property for Disney benefits- I suggest looking into a Disney Value resort. The inside of the hotel room just in general felt damp. Comforters on the beds were both damp. Friendliness of the staff was much less than acceptable, and I did not enjoy getting wrong information and a threat to tow my vehicle when it was their mistake.

With the exception of valet parking for $25 per night, there is no other parking on this property. If you don’t want to pay for the valet service, you most likely will have to park your vehicle a few blocks away from the property on the street.

51,"The picture on Expedia was misleading to actual property. The photo of the lobby was accurate, however. The location is great and the grounds are well kept. The actual room was a bit different. The bathroom was extremely small with little room to move let alone fit two guests. The bathtub was cracked/peeling off in one corner and there were stains on the tub floor. Also, there was no mirror in the room aside from the mirror in the bathroom which wasn't conductive to two guests. We most likely won't be staying at this location again.

The room was nicely updated and quite- except for the air conditioning unit. That thing rattled on and off throughout the night. But we were so exhausted from being in the parks all day that it didn’t wake us after the first night. Walking to the parks took about 10 minuets. The room was spacious and didn’t feel cramped with four people moving around. The bathroom was nice and clean with decent counter space. Shower was big and had enough room to move without touching the sides. Could use more places to put your stuff on though. Very small corner shelf so had things on the shower floor. 
 First time staying here but won’t be our last.

 Only bummer was photos make everything look much more grand than it really is. The foyer is underwhelming in comparison to the photos on this site. The room looks spacious and wonderful in the photos, but in reality was very small. Given that it’s New York... the size isn’t really that shocking, but when you are expecting more from the photo, it’s a little blah?

66,"The property was great but we had issues with the day shift and not getting a room for over 5 hours. When we arrived the ""system just went down"", and no rooms were able to be given. I was told to write my name and phone number on a piece of computer paper and they would call when the system was back up. We checked our bags at the baggage counter and waited 1.5 hours before we got tired of waiting and went to the park. After 5 hours we returned from the park and the system was back up, no call or anything. I have a 7 and 5 yr old and we just flew from KC and they were dirty and tired.The day manager stated that he couldn't comp the room for the night because he didn't have authority to do so but gave us a free breakfast. He gave us a room key and when we got to the room and tried to go in there was someone already in the room, this was at 12:00am. I returned to the front desk and the night manager was there and he upgraded us to the tower, ok that's fine. We get to the 10th floor tried the key, it didn't work. So I had to drag my kids and wife back down to the lobby. This time he gave us a room key that worked but we still didn't know where bags were. The night manager was awesome. He ,for some reason, had the ""authority"" to comp us 2 nights and give us another free breakfast. The night manager was a great help and did everything he could to make sure he cleaned up the other managers mess. He even brought our bags to our room personally. He was the best part of the hotel.

73,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for her birthday. Prior to my stay I messaged the hotel about any additions for the birthday that if they added I would pay for in advance and appreciate. None of that happened. Upon check in the front desk woman was coarse and seemed overworked. I had questions about the amenities and she quickly averted the topic. The bartenders in the lobby were nice but it seemed that everyone was from another country(that’s all they talked about). That’s fine with me but it became noticably worse when they were arriving to work visibly hung over. 
 
 The “resort” is fine. At check in we were handed a map that let us know where everything was. There was a quiet pool On that map that we were looking forward to, however the reality is that it was unmonitored and often over run by kids and louder adults. The same with the hot tub. There is no spa here despite what is advertised. There is a small gym open to anyone and a sauna - and during our stay there were kids everywhere so we didn’t bother to use these features. Also - there are ducks on the property. For me and my girl we enjoyed them and know that in Florida wildlife comes with staying anywhere. However it was really disheartening to see kids and young adults violently chasing them away at times. It the hotel can staff some outdoor attendants to inform and assist with how the resort should run, our stay would have probably been a lot better

81,"We were only comfortable 1 of the 7 nights we stayed in this hotel. I rented two rooms, both were changed day 3 due to cold showers the prior two nights. Then the hot water in the entire hotel went out and they lied for several hours before it was fixed instructing is to run the water for 15 minutes, just 2 more minutes...until I went to the desk and they finally said the repair had just begun. Another cold shower, and left in the morning. When we returned, the bed had water on it dripping from the air conditioner vent and the AC was not working correctly. Since it couldn’t be fixed, all furniture was moved to the side out of the drip area which meant I couldn’t sit on the bed without hitting my head on a light, and no AC for that evening. The next day they lied again saying it had been fixed. I had to call for them to move the furniture back and then looked up to see more water on the vent. We pushed the furniture over ourselves and slept like that the rest of our stay, without the AC working properly. After talking to every single manager and getting nowhere I had to wait two hours one morning day 6 to speak to the director of operations who all but accused me of lying because why would he “take a customers word over his employees?” He took 6 days off of one of my rooms. My second room that had been changed the same day as the first smelled like rotten eggs the entire time but maintenance did nothing and the director of operations wasn’t willing to do anything.

The hotel's gym is pretty big and comes with a lot of treadmills and other equipment.

Once I was on my floor, I had to turn several corners and go down short hallways to my room which felt very unsafe. As a single woman, I don't want to be trapped in a corner with someone I don't know (which happened). I would not recommend staying here.

112,"I did not like house keeping. They were rude and non- compliant with noise. One staff had music playing while she was cleaning and they were yelling to each other across the hall about non work related conversations.
 
 It was so loud we have to walk out and open the door to tell them we are trying to sleep. I was in disbelief that it was house keeping and not just other people at the property. 
 
 Then the other issue I had was we found a roach running around on the carpet and I took a photo of the roach and killed it. 
 
 The carpet of my room 156 looked dingy and worn down, I was very displeased with my stay to the point where the price was way to high for a Wyndham, or did Wyndham just hit an all time low. I truly felt like I was at a motel 6 or lower. 
 
 All in all not happy about the accommodation, and truly displeased. I guess it’s my fault for not reading reviews while booking.

128,"This hotel is one of the best deals you can find to stay on the resort. However, don’t get fooled by the reception that is shared with the higher end Wyndham lake Buena Vista. The Wyndham Garden is dated, and let’s say not much love or attention is being put in.
 
 As soon as you check in, you’ll be dragged to a counter of someone who, by bribing you with restaurant coupons, will actually try to sell you membership to their Club. To access the “Sunset” part or the resort, take an elevator (that’s probably one of the slowest on the planet). It took us more than 4 minutes to get the elevator and go down one floor. If you don’t have have luggage.
 
 An old, dusty smell will great you in a yellowish setting that is your room. And probably your neighbors will greet you too because the walls are so thin. The room is however very clean and the bed is comfortable. There is a serious lack of power plug near the bed. Thanks to an ingenious setup of MacBook and a lot of cables, we were able to charge 3 devices at night. 
 
 We grabbed a muffin at their “cafe”. It was probably from three days ago.
 
 The day of the checkout, if you’re not already up thanks to your neighbors alarm clock, expect to be waken up at 8:30am by staff knocking & asking you when you expect to be leaving. Please, don’t blame the staff — they’re just following management instructions.
 
 Checkout experience was a “You’re good to go” mumbling. No room for feedback there.
 
 Magical stay.

140,"After staying here several times during the past six years, this was likely our final stay. The location is excellent, it's about a five minute walk to Disney Springs. The pool is great and has a section that's wonderful for kids. The food at the pool, although a little pricey, is pretty good. Both the park shuttles and beds were great.
 
 However, the last two times we have stayed the housekeeping has been less than ideal. I gave them the benefit of the doubt last time and thought maybe we had the same housekeeper every time and they were just having some bad days but it happened this trip too. The tile floors were not cleaned during our stay and we had two people with long hair. The tub did not seem to get cleaned because a rusty stain started appearing from the dripping however I think they did try because two days when we came back for the evening, the tub was plugged and water was standing in it. We had the garden view on our other trips and this time we were stuck in the back by the employee parking. We missed the view but thought maybe it would be quieter since less people were walking past, etc. But the car alarms all night made up for it. The hotel room wasn't showing too much wear other than the tub definitely needed to be refinished as there were several peeling spots.
 
 I have recommended this hotel to many people due to our previous experiences however this trip was disappointing and for a small amount more, next time will stay on property.

147,"Overall, it was a very nice resort. This trip was a surprise for my daughter's 17th birthday and I would like to give a special thanks to Deborah and Ali at Tesoro Cove who brought her out a cupcake and sang happy birthday to her ! She really loved it and nothing really phases her (not even the surprise trip) ! 
 .....I feel like there should have been a shuttle bus to Universal Studios from the resort as well as to Disney. The shuttle buses eliminate the costly expense of parking.
 .....I ordered room service two of the nights that we stayed and I was under the impression the charges were take from my account at the time the food was delivered but when I checked out, I was given the bill for room service and other charges. I was not given the option of having it debited from credit card and I would have preferred that to having more charges added to my already expensive bill.
 Maybe I misunderstood but I thought when I booked the trip through Expedia that everything except resort fees were paid for but when I checked in I was charged another $300 which was refunded but I was not prepared for that, I could have budgeted a little better for the trip.
  Nevertheless, it was taken care of. My next trip will be a planned a little better and I will stay somewhere a little less expensive and somewhere that provides transportation to more places. Considering we were out all day, I didn't need such a fancy resort. I still think the resort was beautiful and staff are very friendly.

 I stay here when seeing a show at the Garden, and the location really can't be beat if that is why you are in town. 
 The A,C,E subway line is literally around the corner and if that doesn't suit your fancy, Penn Station is just a block up where you can catch any number of trains. 
 
 The staff are always friendly and willing to help. Lobby is perfectly airconditioned which is great on Summer days!
 Be aware if you want to check in early, they want 50 bucks to do so.
 Bed was comfy, and I didn't hear any noise from hallway/neighbors. 
 My room was 9th floor I think, and there was still considerable noise from the street. Nothing that ear plugs couldn't fix.
 
 The elevators, despite being numerous, notoriously run slow. 
 Rooms do not have fridge or microwaves.
 Those are really the only downsides. 
 Honestly, if you are coming from out of town to see a show at the Garden and the room rates are reasonable? STAY HERE
 You'll love it.

The rooms seemed a little outdated, we stayed in an outside room (our door didn’t exit to an interior corridor) and our room never got cold, we had the ac running constantly. But the room was great because we brought our dog along and it was very easy to walk her with the exterior room. Also, our bathroom fan didn’t work which was strange. So besides the AC, the bathroom fan, and the semi out of date rooms, the hotel is nice! No signs in the lobby tho for check in etc, the pool was great, the gatorville restaurant was our go to for breakfast because everything was already prepared and not expensive at all. The fitness center was tiny! Not sufficient for a leg or back workout, and the WiFi in our room was horrible, not only that but sometimes our phone wouldn’t receive service either. Uber has no problem picking us up or dropping off. The hotel is also near a bunch of restaurants for convenience.

181,"Arrived at 11:30am last Saturday and was told check-in was at 4pm. (There was also a group of over 100 loud girls in the lobby so this was a tad annoying.) OK. At 3:55, we went to the front desk and the room was still not ready. First red flag. There was another family ahead of us who seemed to have the same issue and they arrived at noon. I went back in line after 4PM and again, room wasn't ready. It was at this point that I ""asked to speak to the manager"" 20 minute wait and no manger came out but the front desk all of a sudden had a room ready for us. We went to the room and wow, the madness continues. There were bugs in the room, the toilet wouldn't flush, the safe was not working and the hotel room looked like a dump. It didn't look like what I had reserved. I called front desk to speak to the manager and we switched our room to another one and was told that there were two buildings for the hotel and we were in the one I did not request. We were told we could switch to tower next day at no extra cost.The next day, we go to Epcot and come back to pick up our rooms keys. 9th floor in the tower. We fall asleep and not an hour later we keep hearing loud girls in the hall slamming doors, singing, and one point, music. It went on the whole night. Why were we placed on the 9th floor with the 100 girls. This area should have been blocked for them. Next day at breakfast, we were asked how our night was and we said it was terrible due to noise from the teens and even the STAFF knew

Really nice people working in the hotel, too. But the pullout sofa bed was terrible—our son ended up sleeping on the floor because he said it was better than the terrible mattress. Also, just one drawer in the closet, and it was odd to put clothes in desk and nightstands. There was room for a small dresser in the suite so this seemed like an oversight. But a mostly pleasant stay.

Examples: when arrived my 2 beds room was not available since the property manager had “guests” in the hotel not registered that had taken my room (and another); I was given my key and when I eneterd my room it was occupied and this is how the unregistered guest were discovered .... I was changed into 2 room (disappointing as I was with my kids). The new room had dirty bedsheets, no toilet paper and door lock not functioning (not nice given that somebody maybe issued a key for an occupied roon as it happend to me). The next day when I returned to the room the room was not done.... I called and the reception required me to go down and get keys for another room.. I was extremely disappointed to be forced to change again the room.... but there was no way to stay in my room sunce they would not make it therefore me and my kids had to move to another room (this time 2 beds)... The new room had the phone not working. In summary a poorly managed property, a lot of staff is Chinese as well and speek little or broken English and keeps the property up to the chinese hoteleries standards.............

 First of all I booked my one night stay at this hotel since it was showing competitive prices at the Expedia website, fool of me to pick it just for 10 bucks difference, at the end when I arrived at the hotel I had a terrible surprise to pay, as the lobby assistant told me, a mandatory 25 dollars charge for resort usage fee and 20 dollars for self parking fee. For 45 dollars more I would have gone a totally better hotel than this. The building is old, it is an open type facility like a motel kinda thing, see pictures of the hotel before you book, and the worst part, the walls are so thing that you can hear everything from room to room, I went to sleep at 2 am from the noise being made either at the next room or the room on top of me. I called many times to the lobby and asked them to do something about it, but they didn't. Terrible experience, over priced and couldn't sleep at all. If you are traveling with children, or you want to sleep at night or to avoid any hidden nasty fees forget about this hotel.

260,"This is the second time we've stayed at this property. We like the convenient location near I-Drive which is walkable. The one thing that we didn't care for on this visit was the lack of umbrellas at the pools. There were maybe 4 umbrellas total surrounding two pools. The first time we were here, there was an umbrella for ever four lounge chairs. This being summer and over 90 degrees on any given day, a little shade is necessary. It was so hot we couldn't stay at the pool for more than an hour as we had nowhere to retreat from the sun. Also, the pool towels were lacking as well. In two days we had to ask for the towels to be replenished and on Sunday the pool attendant said we would have to wait an hour for towels and that we should go back to our room and take our room towels to use that day. The lack of people at the pool would probably be an indication that the abscense of shade and towels was an issue for others as well. We come to Florida to spend time at the pool and to not be able to do what we love to do on vacation will certainly come into play when we schedule our next visit. Unless the umbrella situation changes, we will not stay here again.

When we got to the room, we thought the door wasnt working but soon realized you had to literally body slam the door to get inside which was funny the first few times but became a bit inconvenient. Check out was easy as well, once more super nice staff. 
 
 We had stayed only one night and moved to another hotel on disney property for convenience. We realized we left a blanket at the hotel, capled back the next day to ask about getting it back. No one knew where it was so they said they would call us back. It took two days to find it but eventually they did after a few phone calls and were very pleasant about the whole thing. We unfortunately already left orlando so they are shipping it to us. 
 
 Over all the property is a bit dated but functional and the staff really couldnt have been any nicer! Will be stay there again despite the minor events.

You can’t tell which one is cold or hot because the water would perfectly warm and then you would get cold water all the sudden then hot, but it was ok for two nights. The cafe in the lobby could be better. My husband and I went up to get a cup of coffee and we just stood there. It was open. So we went across the st to Starbucks. The rooms are small, well ours was but that’s what you get in NYC. Especially since it was built in 1930 which is pretty cool!
 
 I loved how there is a gentlemen standing near the elevators and you have to show your room key so no one can wander the halls that isn’t staying at the hotel. Very very professional staff. Lobby very nice with a lot of seating to wait or rest. We were upgraded on our room. Right across the st from Madison Square Garden which is where we went. Overall, I would stay again for convenience, kind staff and nice rooms if you only have two people or 3 and the stay is 2-3 days. I don’t know it would have been ok. Wish they had a breakfast bar because the diner gets too busy. Thank you!

When it rains , usually hotels provide umbrellas free of charge for hotel guest but this hotel charges US$25 as a deposit . We stayed at this hotel for 6nights n decided to join a 2day one night tour to Boston over the weekend n recheck into hotel again on Sunday for one more night before moving off to atlanta . We hv to leave our luggages with the concierge n the hotel charged us $10 per bag for depositing over the weekend . This is the first time I stayed at a hotel where keeping the bags aside has a charge.That really shock us . When we asked for a receipt, was told that they only accept cash n no receipt will be issued . 
 This will be the last they see us & I strongly do not recommend anyone who is on holiday to stay in this hotel . Confirm your happy holiday will be ruined.

297,"As an Australian family with two children (5&7yrs) on holiday in the US, visiting Disneyland & California Adventure Park for four days, we loved staying at Wyndham Garden Hotel. See our positive comments below:
 
 The hotel was close enough for a 7-8 minute direct walk to the outer security point of the parks, we visited either once or twice a day (with a break in afternoon), we did not feel unsafe and even after the 9pm World of Light show or 9:30pm fireworks, there were still lots of people/families walking back along with us
 
 The staff at the hotel were genuinely friendly, helpful, the rooms were clean, our kids loved the two outdoor pools (luke warm & warm temperature which was great!) during our break from the parks in the mid-afternoon and we looooved the latte coffees from the cafe in the lobby area!! (A big plus for parents each morning!) 
 
 A huge plus were the surrounding businesses:
 - Two supermarkets/pharmacies with everything you’d want, 30 second walk 
 - Blaze Pizza across the road, with good sized wood fired pizzas with sauce, cheese and two toppings (we went Hawaiian) for $9.99 enough for an adult and our two kids only just finished one between them, awesome pizzas, crusts, staff were busy but happy, a really good relaxing dine in after a long flight/day in the park, went there twice in four nights
 - The Panda Chinese Restaurant in the row of shops adjacent to the hotel, 30 second walk, with really good (really large) Sweet & Sour Chicken, large fried ri

When the staff tried to install the fridge, there was no room and no electrical plug. We tried to call the front desk, but they didn't answer. We went down to the lobby to request another room that would accommodate a small refridgerator. We were told that they were sold out and did not have any other rooms. So, I was forced to put my medication on ice, but that did not last all night. The next day, after 4:00pm, we were given another room that would accommodate a small fridge. Another problem with the room was the bathroom. It had a pedestal sink with a mirror above the sink and a 4 inch wide X 3 foot long glass shelf below it. There was nowhere to store any products. All toiletries had to be repacked daily. If you want a small fridge, coffee maker, etc. in your room, you have to pay a fee for each item. The security was very good, and the housekeeping staff were friendly and excellent.

I showed him all the bites and he took pictures of my arms, legs, and neck. He took down my contact information and said he was going to check out the room and get back to me. He also looked at me like I was making this up!! That was Monday morning and it is now Thursday morning and I have not heard back from him. We have stayed at this hotel several times before because it is close to Disney Springs. In the future, I will look at other properties. Very disappointing and hard to believe I was treated this poorly. Nothing like ruining a Disney vacation with aggravating itching at the parks...

368,"We found the facilities offered by the Wyndham Bonnet Creek properties fantastic, from Lazy Rivers to Mini Golf to BBQ areas to Eateries. It was a great place to relax after a full on day at Disney World (just down the road) or Universal Parks (20min drive away). There are also a lot of planned activities around the complex but the Hotel dint really advise of any of this, we actually found out in the activities area of one of the other towers, im sure they would had advised us if we had asked at reception. A couple of downsides, laundry facilities, we stayed for 16 nights so needed to do some washing, the complex doesnt have a laundry so the only drop off service we could find was 20-25mins away, so all in all for drop off and pickup about 2hrs. House keeping also let the Hotel down, threee days in a row the kids bunk beds were not made up, couple of days where towels were not replaced, taken but not replaced, our daughters bed one night had not sheet, just a blanket. A lot of other small things but when you are paying a good amount of money you also expect them.

I couldn’t even pay a fee to check in early because the girl at the counter said she had to call a manager to see if any rooms are ready. Honestly I feel like she just didn’t want to deal with me or the 5 other people kept waiting because there was an elderly couple that checked in right before me & they got a room. Everyone else was forced to wait for 3pm. She didn’t call a manager. She was on her phone texting. And while she was checking in the elderly couple she answered her personal phone to chat. Talk about unprofessional! Same thing happened at check out. I only needed the room for a few hours to get some sleep so I didn’t even stay the whole night. I’m waiting at the counter for at least 5-10 minutes before someone assisted me now mind you there are 2 girls at the counter this time around and no line. I was the only one in the lobby! One was actually on the phone with a customer so she obviously couldn’t help me. Fine. The other one was texting on her phone & completely ignoring me! I was really unsatisfied with the staff. The one one that actually made me feel like a valued customer was the man that checked me in. Smiled when approached. Very attentive and checked me in a timely manner while explaining how to use the shower and about breakfast hours. You need to fire the 2 girls that are always on phone!

First day they woke us up early by continuously knocking until we opened the door. Second day they left tons of towels on the dressing table and third day our room wasn’t even made. The manager and front desk staff were excellent and genuinely apologized. The manager on duty personally attended to us until it was cleaned and even comped the resort fee for that day. Other than that, this property is excellent. Location, service, cleanliness, amenities are top notch.

379,"When we checked in at around 2:00am in the morning, the clerk gave us the key to a room with 2 queen-sized beds instead of the one we booked via Expedia - 2 beds plus 1 bunker bed. As soon as I found out the discrepancy I rushed to the front desk. At first the man was very haughty and told me they did not have the room type we ordered and paid for, even without an apology for this situation. So I request for a partial refund, he refused and said that we had booked room via Expedia, we should ask for refund or compensation from Expedia not the Hotel directly. I was cross and continued to explain to this guy that the bunker bed was what we had promised to our daughter and now my daughter was so frustrated up there. Maybe due to my persistence, he at last told me that there was only and the last such room as I had booked. Since the guest hadn’t showed up yet, he agreed to change us to that room. And at 3:00 we finally moved to the room with a bunker. But the experience we had undergone was so unhappy. I should say this is a really costly hotel but with unsatisfying customer services in synch with its charges. I think I deserve an apology. So I won’t recommend it.

The room let in so much noise it was hard to sleep. We put the do not disturb sign out daily and we still had someone some in to our room while we were gone. Parking was good for most of the visit as long as you got back to the hotel early. Two nights we couldn’t find parking. I was upset because it’s something we had to pay extra for daily and I felt I should be able to park when having to pay. The front desk was helpful and said our daily parking fee could be used towards valet, so that made it a little easier to deal with not having a spot. Overall, it was a good deal and so nice to be able to walk to Disney springs.

The room was small and dark and had no fan in the bathroom and there was a long hair on the back of the door and a smudge on the tub. No coffee?? Adolescent/college kids were super loud in the next room and the sound seemed to go right through the wall. Also hated how I had a $37 service fee for WiFi. I was aware I was going to be charged, but it’s false advertising the base price and just makes me distrust and hate the hotel from the get-go.

433,"In my opinion, it’s unacceptable for a hotel to not have your room ready at the 4pm check in time. I arrived at 3:55pm, had plans for my family to shower after traveling there and then leave at 5:30pm to get to an engagement at 6pm. I had to complain at 4:45pm and then only did I get a room. 
 
 Secondly, I called at 8am to speak to the concierge and ticket agent about theme park discount tickets for the next day. I specifically said we would be there for one day and wanted to visit one park. I asked if there were discounts to purchasing through the ticket agent at the hotel and the agent said yes, up to 50% discount, but only after I checked in. I said ok and waited to purchase my tickets and thereby waited to select fast pass options. Upon arrrival to the hotel, I found out there was no discount for one day tickets AND with the agents “convenience fee”, tickets were MORE expensive than me purchasing them myself online. I’d appreciate honesty from my morning phone call instead of duplicity. 
 
 On a bright note, the room was clean. Because of the above two experiences, I would never stay there again. 4pm check in should mean 4pm check in, especially after spending roughly $200+ for a room for the night.

I was told they had a hot tub but it was out of order. I was also told there was continental breakfast yet the girl at the front desk just rudely point to the bar & grill in the parking lot. I went to the bar & grill and waited over 45 minutes to be seated and still was not told how the breakfast worked. They were very understaffed and had no (poor) customer service. When I was given a menu, I ask again how the continental breakfast worked and what was included. The man helping me just grabbed the menu and said “continental” and walked away. A little while later I received fruit which was surprisingly fresh and a hard pastry which looked and tasted a day old. My coffee cup was dirty and I was not acknowledged the rest of my visit.. not even a thank you etc on the way out.. (or on the way in) My room was fair. Bathroom was dirty, old and had rust stains from the bar in the shower... overall it was not a great place to stay. I will choose a different hotel next time I am in the area.

There are restaurants nearby and the bar in the lobby has deals for breakfast. It's also right across the street from a Walgreens and CVS. What really sets this hotel apart however is the Customer Service. Stacey and her staff really went out of the way to make us feel at home as well as helped resolve an important lost luggage issue with us after we had already left their hotel (our fault). We will definitely be staying here on future trips to Disneyland and I highly recommend this property.

472,"I liked that it was very close, within walking distance, to Disney Springs. We wished that there were more characters at the character breakfast. Also, the day that we arrived, we were able to eat at the breakfast, and they still did have a wide variety of choices, then the next time that we ate there, which was a little earlier, there weren't as many choices, and we feel that we didn't really get our money's worth that day. The busing to and from the parks was very helpful, although it would be nice if they had busing every 15 minutes instead of every 30 minutes before park openings and after closings because the buses were extremely overcrowded. 
 The rooms were clean, and the staff was very nice and helpful! We will definitely plan on staying here again! Hopefully the next time we come, the weather will be warmer and we can try out the really cool looking pool!!!

The floor was so dusty and dirty! Even after housekeeping came by, still dirty. The sheets also felt dirty. Curtains almost broke on us trying to close it. If you’re looking for a peaceful night sleep. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. Paper thin walls! You can hear people up and down the hallway. You can hear the room next door and downstairs.

There isn't an actual closet in the room so we were only able to hang what we were wearing the next day and basically lived out of our suitcases. That said, the staff was friendly and efficient--true to Disney form. Although we didn't use the pool, it looked lovely.

The reason I say this is that the shower was made that you could roll in, no step up or down, the floor was sunken down so the water would drain. Also when I asked the woman as I was leaving if this was the DELUXE room she stated, Oh you made this reservation through a 3rd party, I said yes, then she stated well you got the 2 bed room. I don't believe this was a deluxe room. The wall paper was starting to come off in the bathroom, very small room. Not a happy camper. Thank You

545,"It is the first time an hotel really does the check in at 3 PM which is very late. After traveling i needed to rest for an important interview. Finally at 3 pm they gave me a key to a room which temperature was outside temperature (40s), I tried everything with the heat system for 30 minutes and ended up giving up. At the front desk, the lady started telling me I’d have to wait for the service guy about 30 minutes (on Sunday...). I told her I had an interview and really needed to relax. It is the first time she looked at me in all our encounters (hallelujah), and finally agreed to change my room... 
 The rooms are absolutely not soundproof. So after all that business I had my neighbors having sex and then yelling at each other’s. 
 The elevators buttons were so dirty, you were getting sick by just looking at them. 
 I will not go back to that hotel. 
 Just treat people decently.

 Overall I found the hotel unpleasant and surprisingly disappointing, especially for Wyndham. 
 Our room was more than outdated, but dirty. Anyone that travels and stays in hotels a lot... it had that depressing unclean feeling. I could’ve stayed somewhere much nicer for a lot less money. 
 Service was lacking- it took 40 minutes, and 3 phone calls for valet to deliver our bags to the room upon check in ( I should have self parked for the exact same cost and carried my bags). Had issues with check out, took forever. 
 I ordered two kids meals from room service and they were meh. 
 I’m not high maintenance and have realistic expectations. I wouldn’t stay here again.

En in de buurt zitten heel veel eettentjes waar je kan ontbijten. Enige minpuntje was toen wij de laatste dag de koffers weg lieten zetten omdat we ‘s avonds gingen vliegen en 12.00 uur moesten uitchecken dat we € 5 per koffer en tas moesten betalen en dat loopt aardig op als je met je gezin bent, zelfs voor een klein tasje moest je € 5 betalen.

We kept the bathroom door closed to block the cold and sound to sleep comfortably, but then the bathroom felt like a country hick out house. You know out house as in a deep hole with a shack build over it out side in the cold. I know its Manhattan busy city but we were on the 26th floor and the window let alot of strert sounds bellow through..the rest of the hotel was nice.

 最後にネガティブな点も少々。
 １．シャワールームのドアが存在しない、すなわち半分しか敷居がないので、シャワー使用時トイレの方にどうしてもお湯が飛び散ってしまう。
 ２．スリッパを置いていなかったのは残念。
 ３．デスクがあったのはありがたかったが、その頭上の照明の明るさがまるきり足りなくて、本などを読める環境ではない。

When we returned in the afternoon to claim our bags, the service was even worse. We were second in line and waited for 20 minutes and they had not even retrieved the previous customers bags. We were frustrated since we were trying to make a train home, I spoke to a front desk clerk about the issue. Fortunately, he was able to get our bags quickly.

Vi bode på 8:e våningen och horde allt som hände nere på gatan kl 04.00 och framåt. Otroligt slitet hotel, sunkiga heltäckningsmattor. Otroligt skitig matta på rummet. Under dörren till badrummet, ett lager av smuts. Väldigt hårda kuddar som gjorde det omöjligt att använda dom när man sov.
 Vid utcheckning så försökte hotellet ta ytterligare ca 2000kr (ca 200USD) extra för avgifter och skyllde på Expedia/Hotels.com. Jag vägrade att göra detta till mitt problem. Slutade med att jag betalade det pris jag fått bekräftat inkl skatter och avgifter + 10USD. Varför jag nu skulle betala det men för att bli kvitt problemet accepterade jag det.
 + till att hotellet tog detta utan större tjat, uppgraderad till 2-rummare med bäddsoffa vilket var bra med 4 I familjen men att kalla det på Executive floor är roligt med tanke på hur det är I Asien.

636,"Fantastisk god beliggenhed tæt ved 5. Avenue. Time square og generelt i god gåafstand til mange attraktioner. Metroen går 100 meter fra hotellet. Der er udmærket morgenmad uden at imponerer i forhold til dansk morgenmad standard Rigtig god kaffe. Der ligger flere morgenmads restauranter i gåafstand, men det er faktisk rarest at benytte sig af hotellets restaurant, da man går rigelig i forvejen til alt andet man ønsker at se. Personalet er super venlige, service mindede og imødekommende. Vi boede i Premium lejlighed som er pænt stor med 2 dobbelt senge. Men i det vi er 5 mennesker og der var en sofa som ikke var til opredning, måtte vi sove 3 i en seng. Det gik lige for os selvom det var lidt træls. 10 sal var fint. Ingen nævneværdig gade støj udover hvad der er normalt for en store by. Ligger op ad en police station, hvilket car uproblematisk. Stille gade af New York standard og alligevel så tæt ved alt. Hotellet er hyggeligt og det fungerer efter hensigten. Der er en roof top bar som ser hyggelig ud når den er åben. Vi var der i Februar. Fint motionscenter.

Also we didn’t leave the city till late and had to check bags and I have never had to pay for this service. $5 a bag is a rip off when this is usually free!! Not impressed with this property at all! Especially when it’s suppose to be a VIP property on Expedia! What a waste of our points.

The rooms are okay. They are clean, but run down. The internet was slow. The pools were nice, we did have to wait to use the hot tub due to capacity limits. Overall it is a decent hotel.

642,"Our stay here was generally a pleasant one. The king room we reserved was not available at check-in and we were given queen room for the first night, which, in addition to being much smaller, also had a broken closet door, leaking shower fixtures and a lingering smell of cigarette smoke, despite the property being advertised as smoke-free. Thankfully, when we spoke to Amalia at the front desk the next morning, she was very helpful and had us moved to the king room we had reserved. I very much appreciate her help and dedication to customer service.
 
 I cannot say the same for Orbitz. After speaking to two customer service reps, who offered me coupons for future stays but were not authorized to issue a refund, I spoke with a manager who explained there was nothing he could do, because Orbitz's terms of service permit them to give you a different, less expensive room than what you paid for, and there is nothing you can do about it. That right: I paid for a king room, they gave me a much smaller queen room, and then refused to refund the difference. The CSRs I spoke with at least tried to help; the manager clearly did not care whether I got what I paid the company for or not. I've been using Orbitz for over 10 years and have had mostly positive experiences, but they completely dropped the ball this time, and I'm not sure whether I will use them again. The measly amount of rewards I get compared to booking directly is not worth the hassle when something goes wrong.

651,"This is a motel is really a 1-2 star. It's very old and worn. I was very surprised that it's a Wyndham Garden and surprised that it was a motel (not a hotel). I felt mislead by Orbitz's rating of it. There is a free shuttle to the airport, which is about 10 minutes away. That's the best thing to say about it. 
 
 The negatives -- most of the hotel front desk staff were gruff and not very helpful. There's not free breakfast, which I would expect from this type of hotel. The room itself was old with peeling paint and cheap furniture. It is an old motel and there could be the potential for it to be really cool -- there's a little golf putting green and a pool -- but it's not be kept up or refurbished in a nice way. It feels like they're spending the least amount of money to keep it going! 
 
 I don't recommend staying here, especially for the price that they charge.

Puddles everywhere. The hot tub was a slight green. Not sure why, could be the chemicals they use. But it was usable. Pool could definitely be warmer. The rooms are very cramped, the furniture they used is too big for the rooms. Unnecessary double desk you can't push in that takes up a ton of space. Bathrooms are super basic and old.

After the doors opened another guest came up to me and said she reported the elevator not working at 6am Saturday morning, so why was there not a sign or anyone working on the elevator to make sure it was working properly. The general manager did what she thought was best for the families, but it doesn't change the fact our kids are still scared and the panic attacks that they had. It was hot hard to breath and my 10 year old even got a nose bleed. We stayed in this hotel last year for a soccer tournament so we chose this one again this year for a tournament as well. Not sure if this hotel will be our stay next year!

Upon very early check in we were offered an upgrade for 2 queen beds with a large room layout for a small upgrade fee. The room was as described, very roomy and with 2 full baths a terrific plus! The bed was super comfy! I usually have a difficult time sleeping in places away from home and here...it was amazingly quiet and restful!
 The staff were accommodating, helpful and friendly and we would encourage anyone thinking about a stay here to make that reservation now!
 The best part were our meals at the 24 hour in-house restaurant, Tick Tock Diner! What an excellent addition to a great Hotel! The food was fast, hot and delicious and the waitstaff spectacular and friendly! Menu had great variety; feel good prices!
 Only disappointment....we did not get a chance to enjoy fine dining at Butcher and Banker...what a menu offering and the space is very elegant without being pretentious. Definitely next stay...as we will stay at The New Yorker every time we visit NYC!

734,"Property was nothing like Wyndham Hotels used to be. This one was about par with Motel 6 but perhaps not as nice. The room was a very utilitarian, generic ""motel"" room and not what one comes to expect at a hotel. The central A/C controls on the wall did not control the A/C despite the warning sticker on the controller. The room had an old fashion wall unit that sounded like a jet engine. The room was furnished with cheep particleboard covered with black veneer. Of course the room smelled a bit funky but that could have been the old air conditioning unit. 
 We were glad it was nothing more that a place to sleep at night.

Not what I expected from a wyndham property especially for the price paid. We stayed one night and it felt like we were not important to give a proper room so they gave is what was available. Not a 4 star experience more like a 2.5 or 3 and the price was not worth what we paid. Very disappointing stay.

I was also under the impression that I would only have to pay 50 in resort fees once arriving at the hotel however that was not the case and I was never informed it would be a different amount by any of the staff members during check in or check out. Extremely upset that no one explained any of the extra fees. Unfortunately after the long wait experience for the shuttle and the extra charges on my credit card I will not stay again.

763,"1) While we knew about them ahead of time resort fees are not appreciated. Most of all as they are considered ""Deceptive and unfair practices"" by the US Trade Commission as its basically a way to advertise cheaper prices then in our case double them. Anything with Official and Disney advertised as part of it should not allow this. Expedia should be more upfront about this, not small print.
 2) Hotel was clean and in good condition as was the pool.
 3) Counter staff forgot to authorize our parking pass and we almost got our car towed.
 4) They advertise two different rates for parking. One outside ($20) and another inside (counter staff told us $15). 
 5) We did not use valet parking but got charged tax on valet parking???
 6) Front desk failed to tell us about or give us the Extra Magic Hours pass we were entitled too. We heard about it through a 3rd party and had to ask for it with just two days left at the parks.

787,"My family and I were in Orlando visiting family and enjoying nearby attractions and theme parks. After a long day out and about, we were hoping to pull into an easily accessible parking space near our hotel room. Unfortunately this was not the case. Each evening we returned to the property, we had to double park the car and carry our sleeping children inside. After which we then had to come back out and look for parking a few buildings down and walk back to our room. Wyndham Orlando Resort should allocate at least one parking space per room, clearly labeled and conveniently located.
 
 During our stay, the cable also went out for at least 2-days. While the staff acknowledged the matter was being looked into and confirmed technicians were on-site, nothing additional was done. No one was able to provide an ETA for when the services would be restored nor did the staff offer other ways for our family to keep ourselves entertained while in our rooms (e.g. portable DVD player, board games, arts & crafts).
 
 Last but not least, the housekeeping staff failed to replenish our towels on two occasions. The first time we let it go, and made due with what we had. However, on the 2nd incident we had to reach out and ask for towels to be delivered to the room.
 
 While the property itself was in a prime location for our purposes, we unfortunately will not be returning.

This was a major concern since we would be in the parks and outside of the room the majority of the day and we wanted to be sure the cleaning staff was aware of the issue. We arrived back to our room and the door was unlocked. Just a push of the door and anyone could easily enter the room. We let the front desk know again and the issue was never resolved. Thankfully no one took anything from our room, but this is a major issue for people who are traveling with valuables.

814,"We stay at this hotel because of its convenient location, but were really disappointed with the room (210) during our last stay. 
 
 The upholstered furniture was badly stained with brown smears, as was the carpet. 
 
 The wheels of the chair at the desk were jammed so the chair was difficult to move.
 
 We stayed two nights and the towels and washcloths that we left in the bath for replacement after the first night, were removed but not replaced.
 
 The staff were pleasant and friendly. The associated restaurant (across the parking lot) is adequate, but nothing special.

815,"The pictures on Expedia are not a true representation of the property. The guest registration area is renovated and the staff is courteous. When you drive out to find the building where your room is located be prepared to haul your luggage up a flight of stairs as the property does not have elevators to the second floor. The rooms are smaller than they appear online, outdated and cleanliness is poor at best. The balcony was dirty and the sitting area was stained and moldy. I use Expedia for all my travel needs and I have never left feedback but felt that this was just unacceptable.

It is no wonder more restaurants are now kid restricted. Clean hotel, maintained ok, but terrible if you want some peace and quiet.

844,"The hotel is in a great location, literally across one bridge from Disney Springs and the foyer and main section of the hotel are beautifully decorated with great facilities, it's very welcoming! I was on a ground level room, and it does feel slightly 'motel' at first glance as the room was in a block and the car park was directly in front of it, however inside was a great standard, nicely furnished (a little dark of my own choice as I didn't want to open curtains onto the car park) and the shower was great. 
 
 Everyone I encountered working was friendly and happy to help, and the bus services to the parks were great and easily on par with the Disney service (which was one of my worries) as long as you don't mind visiting multiple parks on your way to the one you're going to (tip: if you want to go to Epcot, but missed that bus, get the Magic Kingdom one as it drops you at the monorail station for Epcot too, then get a bus to Disney Springs back later as you can walk from the stop to the hotel easily).
 
 For the price and location I was happy to overlook the room location, and if you're going to spend most of your time at the Parks you'll only really be there at night, so it's not as much of an issue as I first expected! I'd definitely consider staying again!

 Overpriced and certainly doesn’t call for a resort fee on top of the nightly fee.

873,"Initially enjoyed the experience. Problems appeared with the room late in the night as Inwas in the bar for a few hours prior and had only stopped to drop off my bags with my wife before heading down to enjoy martinis.
 
 When getting back upstairs I noticed it was pretty cold in the room. To correct this I turned on the heat a bit higher, as the night went on the room became colder, attempted to walk down to the lobby but saw it was empty for more than 5 min, went upstairs to figure it out on my own. Long story short, the room got to 58 degrees before someone allowed me to start the process of changing rooms around 2am. Originally the issue was that there wasn’t enough staff to help me, the person on the phone finally came up with enough complaining.
 
 I got to another room that was 78 degrees after being in a room that was almost 55 degrees. Once the staff member entered the room they were surprised it was in fact broken. My night and morning were spent dealing with this, preventing me from getting anything done, I ended up fighting the clock to get my work done before check out, when checking out, I tried to communicate my night to the staff member who was actively avoiding that convo as she never even asked how my night was. I ended. Up finishing my work in the lobby until my morning meeting.
 
 It’s a great hotel and the perfect location in relation to my clients. Also, rooms can’t all be perfect, just would have been nice for a much better communication and response.

Being right across the walk bridge to Disney Springs and then being able to use the Disney transportation options was The room wasn't anything to speak of (no pictures on the wall, very drab), but who stays in the room when you are in Disney? My only real complaint was check in. We arrived very early and I was certain the room would not be ready but the lady that checked us in said since check out was at 11:00 and we had arrived so early we would be the first to check in when a room was available. At 2:30 I checked back and was told we were second in line, but I had seen others checking in and receiving rooms. At 3:45 while standing in line again to see if a room was ready there were two other check ins, both with the same room I had reserved, and they were checked in immediately and given keys. When I explained this to the clerk, I immediately had a room. Of course, I was suppose to have received a phone call when the room was available (hours prior to this) and never received one. They need to improve the check in process if you ask me.

I truly had no idea the rooms are outside access. Guess that’s what Garden means? They put us on the parking lot side but when I asked for a change to poolside (interior, quieter courtyard) they were able (luckily) to accommodate us. Rooms are nice. Front blind and curtain configuration strange. I am a person who notices small things like chipped paint, not keeping up appearances, etc. and there was some of that. Would I stay again? No, just because I don’t like outside access, it might not concern someone else though.

We had two nice size bathrooms and loads of places to sleep not to mention a bar and spacious sized rooms. Very convenient location to walking to all the sights and walking to our train station. I loved that we could store our bags while not checked in yet. Overall great jog TRYP.

Room was immaculate. We were on the 21st floor which is slightly dated but with the level of cleanliness we and grumble. The plug sockets were not great. Whatever you have plugged in keeps falling out so you have to be really careful! We were faced with a hidden facility charge and as a good will gesture the bill was halved as the facility charge includes everything we had no intention of using i.e conference room, gym, room telephone etc and unfortunately it is a mandatory fee. I would stay in the hotel again.

 The New Yorker is located right near Penn station, making exploring the rest of Manhattan a breeze. 
 
 The room was quite small and a bit dated, but we didn’t go to NYC to spend a lot of time in our hotel room. It was clean and provided what was needed: a warm shower and a place to lay our heads after full days of walking and sightseeing. 
 
 The staff was friendly and accommodating. 
 
 There is a gym in the building equipped with elliptical, treadmills, stationary bikes, free weights, and various machines (shoulder press, chest press, lat pull down, quad extension, etc.).

I ask the police officer who made the complaint and they said that someone called them and that we were to loud and that they didn't want to have to come back to my room again
 
 I was in shock when they mentioned that I was making noise late at night and that someone made a complaint.
 
 I didn't quite understand why they had been summons to come to my room when I only checked in 1 hour ago and spent most of that time unpacking and preparing for my business meeting for the next day.
 
 I asked the office who lodged such a complaint and when they arrived at the door did they detect any load disturbing noise
 
 They replied that someone complained and that they don't want to have to come back.
 
 After I assured them that they would not be coming back to my room for any reason they left and I returned inside the room (1265)
 
 I didn't know what to think of the encounter so I called the front desk and ask if there had been a complaint about me or my room and was the night attendant, who checked me in,aware of any complaint made that required the police. He said that he did not know of any incident that require police intervention in particular to my room. I asked if he could look into this for me and get back to me before I checked out in the morning he said ok he would look into it. So far nothing

They were so rough, scratchy, and firm that they could have been burlap potato sacks. We stayed for three days, and each day the fresh towels were equally awful.
 Also the Keurigs were broken in both rooms.

I have stayed at lower end in Disney springs for a fraction of the cost and had good, steady transportation. I was very angry to the point of Wyndham is a never stay for me again!

1040,"From the outside and some yelp reviews we believed that this was a good hotel at reasonable rates. However, after making reservations and realizing that parking is an additional $25/night, the rooms are so poorly designed that two people cannot pass in front of the bed at the same time, the person who ends up in the bed next to the wall cannot even get into the bed from the side but rather has to crawl from the bottom. When we got there and two days after housekeeping cleaned the room, there was no soap for the shower, only a half roll of bathroom tissue, and no closet in the room. Also, there is a slab of marble jutting out where your head should be if you are planning on taking a bath. All this plus witnessing the argument while checking in between the desk clerk and an African American woman who was obviously not being treated right.
 There were several other major issues with this place and I will certainly NOT book another stay at any Wyndham hotel ever again!

 They tried to charge a facilities fee which was fair enough however we did argue that the fee for the first day was a bit unfair given that we couldn’t get into our room never mind use any facilities. They did eventually agree not to charge us.

1089,"Wyndham Garden San Jose Airport was offering a really good rate compared to the other hotels in the area for the dates that I wanted. I stayed in 2 different rooms during my trip to the area and that probably improved my opinion of this hotel. 
 
 I could tell that this was an older property that was probably bought by Wyndham and fixed up a bit. The lobby didn't give me the greatest first impression. The furniture and accent color decor were fine, but I didn't love the low ceiling covered in mirrors.
 
 I walked through the pool area to my courtyard-facing room. The pool area was spotless and the garden looked nice. 
 
 My first room (166) was next to the housekeeping office which had its own noise and traffic. The interior of the room had some nice updates like the sink, the bed, and decor, but the painting seemed poorly done. Perhaps this room only had 1 coat of wall paint; it clearly needed another several to hide the scuff marks and stains. The bed was very comfortable.
 
 My second room (190) was also courtyard facing. The wall painting in that room looked much better and it actually made the whole room as a whole look better. 
 
 The in-room Wolfgang Puck's coffee was horrible.
 
 I really appreciated the shuttle service. They were fast and the drivers were very courteous. Although the reservation information asked me to call ahead to schedule the shuttle, I was told to call back as soon as I was with my bag and ready for pickup.

There was a small stain on the bottom of the blackout blind that I can only guess is dried blood. The shower glass also leaked and the water looks like is water damaging the corner of the bathroom. 
 
 Lastly, I do not recommend using the keurig coffee maker. Clearly, previous guests have used the hotel tap water to make coffee and it can be tasted. Furthermore, I’m pretty sure I got stomach bug from drink from it.

 The sales representatives were all rude beyond belief. 
 That two hour session was so horrific, I will NEVER EVER again set foot in any of your hotels, resorts any more.

When I was heading out to the outlet mall Rick checked and found a coupon for a savings passport which he gave me and indeed saved me some money. We definitely will stay at this hotel next time we’re in Orlando.

Yes, the room was available when I arrived back at the hotel but the check bag person was no where to be seen.

1190,"Central location in New York, between two big railway stations, and in a very animated zone, this hotel could benefit more from a friendlier staff. Checking in and checking out too about 30 minutes each, not only because of too people at the desk (checking out) but also because of some interminable issues with the computer system (checking in). Otherwise, if you are OK with the (almost) permanent noise of syrens from police and fire trucks, and the crowd typical to this zone of New York, you would enjoy being close to almost everything in a veru circulated spot of the megacity. Our room was small and beds short, but this is perhaps we had a toom with a view (to Empire State Building). The other 2-bed room near ours, with no view, was apparently larger and more confortable. All together, this old (~ 90 years) and respectable hotel is what it is because of location. A nice surprise was the nearby Trattoria, a clean, quiet Italian cafe with direct access from the hotel.

But the worst thing was the indefference and the unfriendly attitude of the Front Desk and Housekeeping staff when I asked them for a missing bag of snacks (worth $ 25.00) that -I am assuming- the cleaning lady took it by mistake. They never apologized for that . To be honest, I don't care about the snacks, I care more about the good service and positive attitude. The Front Desk employees were acting like they were doing a favor to the guests, when is the other way around. They only said ""We are going to find out what happened, we will call you soon"". I am still waiting... at least for an apology. Do not go to this hotel, Central Park will be a better place to sleep.

 Aan de negatieve kant staat dat het in een onaangename straat ligt. Het hotel zelf is zeer gedateerd. De kamer die wij hadden was klein, nee erg klein. Zelfs voor New Yorkse begrippen was de kamer erg klein. Nauwelijks bergruimte. Er was maar een kleine kledingkast. Die stond stijf tegen het bed aan, wel een stukje van de muur af, want anders kon je niet bij de lichtknopjes!. De deur van die kast en de deur van de badkamer konden ook niet tegelijk open. De airco maakte ontzettend veel lawaai. Die kon je dus ook 's-nachts niet aan hebben, waardoor het buitengewoon warm en benauwd was (de ramen konden ook niet open). De badkamer was net als de kamer een miniatuur-badkamer en bovendien beschimmeld. De wandjes waren ook zo dun dat je de buren zowat letterlijk kon verstaan. De algemene staat van het hotel was erg gedateerd. Het heeft op zijn minst een grondige opknapbeurt nodig, maar beter is een algehele renovatie. Al met al geen aanrader. Het is zeker geen vier-en-een-halve ster. Op zijn best twee sterren.

The hotel is a great location and it has 2 great restaurants inside of it. The hotel is definitely a NY landmark, therefore, it isn't very modern. Also, the windows aren't sound proof. So make sure you take earplugs.

On the site it says there’s a laundry room, but we asked and there isn’t only laundry service, so dumb. The stay was good though. They need a sign on the door that goes out to the pool because on the hall it shows you where to go, but when we got to the door it had no sign and we weren’t sure if we can open the door thinking it might set off an alarm...

Blinds on the windows were broken and wouldn't close properly. Electrical outlet on the desk was broken, threshold beneath the door provided too much of a gap where concern for insects entering room was prevalent. Calcium buildup on shower head was thick, so maybe a dip in CLR would help. Overall disappointed.

We could tell there were some nice upgrades to the room, (floor tiles, beautiful sink, and mirror, etc). But there were other areas that needed improving. (Bathtub had yellow stains, cabinets/shelves had heavy chipping, the hallway smelled like fresh paint, we could hear conversations and music through the walls very clearly) Also, I was not able to open the sliding glass door to the deck without the help of my husband. (The rollers were broken). So, overall it was an okay stay. I would find a different hotel to stay in the future though.

1312,"My wife does not like elevators. So so we asked for the impossible, a room on the lower floor, with a view. The reception staff were very nice and explained that the lowest floors were given over to students and the hotel proper really stated on floor 20. 
 In the end, the large elevators were fine and although we were on floor 22. We did have a room with a view over the Hudson.
 The Hotel is historic 1930, perhaps not as huge as it was in the 1930's when it had over 2000 rooms but it retains many of the decorative features and style. It's been refurbished a few times. It does show signs of its age, but that is the character.
 Brown paint, deco carpets, a little shabby but that is nicer than some corporate slick hotel. (Yes noisy plumbing, the shower pressure is excellent but it does have a downside if someone next door showers late at night).
 The rooms are modest, some quite small I gather.
 Comfort was good, a nice bed, good linen, sheets changed every day. Housekeeping excellent.
 Noisy air con but it worked. Great shower/bath. 
 So a recommended hotel. With excellent service.

I stepped out to ask them to move away from my room since we had an early flight. Thankfully they were not confrontational. The air conditioner sounded like a plane taking off everyone it kicked on.

Penn Station is only about 2 minutes walk from the hotel giving easy access to the subway and train network. The hotel itself is very comfortable its by no means the most up to date hotel but everything was clean it all worked and I was very happy to have this as my base for my 4 night stay, it was also quiet enough for me to be able to sleep and recover from a hard days sightseeing.

1378,"The entrance & lobby seemed nice. 
 After entrring our two rooms, we immediately saw the drips, dust, hair, damage on all our internal doors & bathroom. At 10:30pm a loud party with music blaring, started in the room connected to us. They were letting at least a dozen guys slip into the exit door for this party. We went to the desk to complain, we came back to being locked out of one of our rooms & no one doing anything to stop the party. Five trips to the front desk in our pj’s (walking around a big spill that no one would clean up) cound not get the door lock to work. It’s now 11:30pm. Party still raging and us huddled with the person who is locked out of their room. A security guy came to help. He was unable and we had to wait 20min for someone to drive to the hotel with their master key to re-set the lock. After I ask security why no one has stopped the party, he pounds on the door. The party raged on till past midnight and we were relocated. We never saw the party get stopped. The next day we were locked out of one of the new rooms and informed we were given the wrong keys. They swapped our room keys so each group stayed in rooms, that were in the names of the other. My sister needed to check out a day before me so, it was a long process to get it straightened out. It made us miss a family breakfast before family left and I returned to my room to be locked out AGAIN. We did not finish our stay. Horrible experience.

Firstly the lack of a thermostatic shower with just hold/cold taps to try and get the balance right meant showers took longer than necessary and left you at the mercy of other people’s water usage. Second the lack of coffee making facilities was another disappointment in what was otherwise a pleasant stay. Also read the booking small print, as there is a $29 PER NIGHT service charge added in, which I wasn’t prepared for at check out.

I made that mistake one day during my stay and went to one of the pool bars on the other side of the resort on the timeshare side and tried to charge the drink to my room and they could not find my room number . I had to go back later to bring my payment later in the day. The staff goes out of your way to be kind and helpful and they gave me an upgrade at no charge since it was my birthday and also a late checkout on the day I was checking out as well.

Checking in at about 5:30 to 6:00 after a very long day we walked into 3 receptionists at the counter 4 people on line ,another staff member took myself to another desk and we both were checked in within 3 -5 minutes!! She was amazed & so grateful for their professionalism, and said from now on I will always book the New Yorker !! She also said I cannot believe I have put up with such poor service for 6 years from the other hotel!!! Thank you WYNDHAM NEW YORKER !!

1474,"This hotel is well kept and the staff are courteous and professional. The location is great because you have a shopping area and movies right behind in walking distance. It is also a nice area that feels safe in Queens. I only wish parking was an amenity to the hotel because parking is difficult and if you use their parking its $25.00 a day. I feel that is expensive and you already paying for your stay.

1486,"PROS - Very friendly and helpful check-in, Great resort layout with a lot of walking areas in a park-like setting, beds were comfy, tons of restaurants and stores in walking distance, having 2 pools was nice.
 
 CONS - Service at Gatorville is mediocre at best, ""Pool bar"" is enclosed now which defeats the purpose of a pool bar, Pool itself is pretty dirty and we never saw anyone tending to it, had to go search for pool towels each of the 3 days we were there, Bathrooms in the Premium rooms are tiny, Kid's Playground has been ""closed for repairs"" for 2 years now!
 
 Overall, we were a little disappointed. Having stayed here many times before, there were a lot of little things that have slipped through the cracks. Garbage cans were full, no towels, didn't see any workers walking through the grounds cleaning up the whole time we were there. We stay here for the location.

Rooms ok - no carpeting, which is a positive for those with allergies, etc. Main issue was the SMELL! The first room I was given reeked of stale cooking oil (there is a kitchenette with a cook top; clearly well used). Smoke/CO2 alarm also going off, so I asked for a different room. Second one - no alarm beeping, but same stale cooking smell. Stuck with this one, but woke with the stench in my nostrils. Not pleasant. Also a call-out to the mystery shower.

Also, as I was attempting to fall asleep, the cleaning staff were extremely loud as they were cleaning rooms, so I had to kindly go out of my room to ask them to keep it down, to which they laughed and continued being loud. My flight had been cancelled and I had dealt with a lot of annoying travel issues, I simply wanted to come to a hotel and relax, feel welcomed and safe, that wasn’t my experience. Every phone call I made to the front desk to ask for help with the room, or the cleaning staff, was never answered. I actually had to call from my cell phone to the front desk to have someone answer.

Easy access to the underground parking garage. Friendly and helpful staff. (They even gave us a late check out, which we greatly needed.) But my absolute favorite thing about it was the bed. We had a king size bed that you just sunk into. Probably one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. I wish I could have taken that bed home with me.
